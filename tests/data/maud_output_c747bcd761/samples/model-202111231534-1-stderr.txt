Informational Message: The current Metropolis proposal is about to be rejected because of the following issue:
CVODES: CVode At t = 847.201 and h = -0.00330767, the error test failed repeatedly or with |h| = hmin. Error code: -3
If this warning occurs sporadically, such as for highly constrained variable types like covariance matrices, then the sampler is fine,
but if this warning occurs often then your model may be either severely ill-conditioned or misspecified.

Informational Message: The current Metropolis proposal is about to be rejected because of the following issue:
Exception: CVODES: CVode Internal t = 36.5715 and h = 1.11518e-18 are such that t + h = t on the next step. The solver will continue anyway. Error code: 99 (in '/home/georg/.virtualenvs/maud/lib/python3.9/site-packages/maud/model.stan', line 135, column 4 to line 180, column 40)
